# Test script to verify the optional BlueMap proxy route on Docker Compose.
#
# No other check builds or runs the nginx image — "Validate Code and
# Configuration" only runs shellcheck and `docker compose config`, and "Test
# Server Run" starts alert-manager and minecraft-wrapper alone — so nothing else
# catches a broken include, a fragment that fails to render, or a route that
# survives being turned off. This script covers that gap. It is run in CI by the
# "nginx Configuration Test" job (.github/workflows/ci.yml) and locally by
# scripts/ci-local.sh whenever a Docker daemon is reachable; run it directly
# after touching nginx/nginx.conf, nginx/entrypoint.sh or nginx/Dockerfile.
#
# The Kubernetes equivalent of these assertions lives in
# helm/omcsi/tests/nginx_test.yaml and runs under `helm unittest`.
